# flora-boards

**A project with the goal of encouraging people to care for plants and share it with others.**

This project is built in a website using simple HTML, CSS, PHP, and javascript. This prototype would _ideally_ be built on MySQL to store it's data on posts, and account information. For now you just need to login for access to the website. You can post pictures of your own plants and let other people like them.
Every month, 4 posts will be chosen depending on some criteria like the health of the plant, it's care location, it's age, etc. In a scaled up version of the project, you would be able to add your own account info and share posts through a link.
